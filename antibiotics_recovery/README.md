This data is species-level data and tracks individuals from Singapore and Canada during
antibiotics treatment. Individuals were grouped into recoverers and non-recoverers based on their
alpha diversity after antibiotics treatment. The authors used the Simpson index for alpha diversity
in their study but we use Shannon here since that is what we discussed in the course. The results
replicate well with that measure.

The data can be found in antibiotics.xlsx.

## Included Tables

**Alpha Diversity**<br>
Shows the Shannon index for pre, during and post antibiotics treatment. Each row is a single 
individual. 

**Keystone Taxa Singapore**<br>
Shows data for two species that are associated with antibiotic recovery for the individuals
from Singapore. The "percentage" column denotes the relative abundance. A value of 1 would mean that
the species constitutes 1% of total sequencing reads in that sample. 
Those two species were tested in mice and shown to improve recovery from antibiotics in mice in the second half of the study.

**Keystone Taxa Canada**<br>
Shows data for two species that are associated with antibiotic recovery for the individuals
from Canada. The "percentage" column denotes the relative abundance. A value of 1 would mean that
the species constitutes 1% of total sequencing reads in that sample. 
Those two species were tested in mice and shown to improve recovery from antibiotics in mice in the second half of the study.

**Singapore**<br>
Percentages of all major detected species in each sample from Singapore. Values denote percentages, so a value of 1 would mean that
the species constitutes 1% of total sequencing reads in that sample. Thus, rows sum up to approximately 100 (100% abundance).

**Canada**<br>
Percentages of all major detected species in each sample from Singapore. Values denote percentages, so a value of 1 would mean that
the species constitutes 1% of total sequencing reads in that sample. Thus, rows sum up to approximately 100 (100% abundance).

## Figures

**alpha_diversity.png**<br>
This shows the alpha diversity time courses for the individuals. Colors denote the recovery status (R - recovery, NR - no recovery).
This illustrates well how recoverers have a higher alpha diversity after antibiotic treatment.
